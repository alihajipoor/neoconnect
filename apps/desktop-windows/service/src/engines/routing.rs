//! Windows routing-table manipulation for engines that don't do it
//! themselves.
//!
//! WireGuard and OpenVPN both install their own routes -- wireguard.exe
//! manages the table from `AllowedIPs`, and OpenVPN acts on the server's
//! pushed `redirect-gateway`. Xray does not: its TUN inbound creates an
//! adapter and waits for traffic, and upstream's own documentation says
//! full-tunnel routing on Windows must be arranged externally, warning
//! that naively routing `0.0.0.0/0` into the TUN makes Xray's own
//! outbound loop back through itself.
//!
//! So this module does what that documentation describes by hand:
//!
//! * a host route to the VPN server via the *physical* gateway, so the
//!   engine's own connection to the node escapes the tunnel it is
//!   creating -- without this the loop upstream warns about is exactly
//!   what happens, and
//! * two half-default routes (`0.0.0.0/1` and `128.0.0.0/1`) through the
//!   TUN. Together they cover the whole address space and beat the real
//!   default route on specificity, which means the existing default is
//!   left untouched rather than deleted and restored. If this process
//!   dies without cleaning up, the machine still has a working default
//!   route to fall back on.
